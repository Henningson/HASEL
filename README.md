**HASEL** (**H**igh-Speed Video **A**nnotation Tool for **S**tructured Light **E**ndoscopy in the Human **L**arynx) is a Deep-Learning-supported tool for generating ground-truth data for High-Speed Video Structured Light Laryngoscopy.
This tool enables to robustly and rapidly generate data of:
* Glottal segmentation with different segmentation architectures
* Vocal fold segmentation via frame-wise interpolation
* Semi-automatic and Deep Learning enhanced generation of laserpoint data.

# Regarding the Glottal Segmentation
Glottal Segmentations can also easily be generated from command line arguments, via the supplied script in the examples:
```
python examples/scripts/segment_glottis --encoder mobilenet_v2 --image_folder PATH_TO_WHERE_THE_IMAGES_Are --save_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

##  Available CNNs
We supply five U-Nets with different backbones in this repository.
They can be downloaded here. Make sure to extract the files into ```assets/models```.
Here is the evaluation of the models.
Generally the resnet based backbones are the best performing, but the other backbones are generally better to use on cpu only systems.
You should generally test out which ones work best for you.
You can find how to use the supplied networks in ```examples/scripts```.
